I can play many different positions but I play best at CDM or holding midfield. I also play video games and my favorite is EA FC 26. I also enjoy playing Minecraft and

<p class="School_life">As said a little bit before about school. I am an all A student and in this new school and I think I got <br>
    the hang of it. My new school, Argyle needed some getting used to. Lockers, fights,<br> 
    new teachers and classmates was a lot of getting used to. Also my former math teacher, Ms El-Haggan <br>
    got forced to leave Argyle. A lot of change but my grade has not dropped in any class because <br>
    of it. I also have many friends like Jeramiah, Lincoln, Tyler and others. This school year started<br>
    and in eighth grade I need keep my focus to continue getting good grades because i'm getting ready for high school <br>
    and to get into the magnet program. I also need to keep my grades up to get into a good college. I want to go to the <br>
    University of Maryland College Park because it is close to home and is a balanced school. I also want to go to Stanford <br>
    or Harvard because they have good computer science programs and will be great for my resume. </p>

<p class="sup">I have parents that are from Ethiopia. There were 2 reasons they left. The 1st was because there was more opportunity in the US.
     The other reason was because they didn't like the leader Abiy Ahmed. I also have one brother named Noah. My mom's favorite athlete is
    Kobe Bryant. My dad's favorite athlete is Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian runner. My brother's favorite athlete is Lionel Messi. Some memories 
    we all have was when we went to 2 soccer games. They were preseason and the games were Brentfond vs Aston Villa and Chelsea vs Fulham. We had so much fun. The score for the first game was
3-3 and the 2nd game was 2-0 Chelsea. Another memory I have is when we went to Virginia Beach. It was a vacation. I loved It! We went inside a sweet hotel,they served us breakfast in a different part of the hotel.
There was a beautiful beach that had very nice waves. While the wave was coming at us we would jump over it. My cousins were there as well so we all enjoyed it together. My mom prefered to watch us do it. It was awesome!</p>
